// You are given a tree with n vertices labelled 1,2,â€¦,n The length of a simple path in the tree is the number of vertices in it. 
// You are to select a set of simple paths of length at least two each, but you cannot simultaneously select two distinct paths contained one in another. 
// Find the largest possible size of such a set.

// Formally, a set S of vertices is called a route if it contains a least two vertices of a simple path in the tree.
// A collection of distinct routes is called a timetable.
// A route S in a timetable T is called redundant if there is different route S' that belongs to T such that S is a subset of S'. 
// A timetable is called efficient if it contains no redundant routes. Find the largest possible number of routes in an efficient timetable.

// Input format:
// First line contains n, which is the number of nodes
// Nex n lines contains u-v pairs of edges

// Output format:
// One integer with your answer

// Example
// Input:
// 4
// 1 2
// 1 3
// 1 4

// Output
// 3
